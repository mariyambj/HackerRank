'''The Utopian Tree goes through 2 cycles of growth every year. Each spring, it doubles in height. Each summer, its height increases by 1 meter.

A Utopian Tree sapling with a height of 1 meter is planted at the onset of spring. How tall will the tree be after  growth cycles?

For example, if the number of growth cycles is , the calculations are as follows:

Period  Height
0          1
1          2
2          3
3          6
4          7
5          14
Function Description

Complete the utopianTree function in the editor below.

utopianTree has the following parameter(s):

int n: the number of growth cycles to simulate
Returns

int: the height of the tree after the given number of cycles
Input Format

The first line contains an integer, , the number of test cases.
 subsequent lines each contain an integer, , the number of cycles for that test case.
